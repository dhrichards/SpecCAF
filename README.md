# SpecCAF: Python implementation of a Spectral Continuum Anisotropic Fabric evolution model 

A spectral fabric evolution model for ice based on the theory of mixtures of continuous diversity (Faria, 2006) that has been shown to reproduce experimentally observed fabrics (Richards et al. 2021). The model incorporates the effects of rigid-body rotation, basal-slip deformation, migration and rotational recrystallization, and requires velocity gradient and temperature as inputs.
